# Redesign of SmartLight.ai's Website: A Case Study
### Why 
For many startups, it is top priority for more time to be allocated to the research and development of the product. Other areas of the business can be neglec

**First impressions count**, especially for businesses looking to seek out potential investors. With first point typically being the website. A good website can reinforce the positive ideas an investor has about the business, whilst a bad website further negatively impacts the busienss. 

For Sept 2024 mobile devices make up **61.72%** of internet traffic, whilst desktops fall short with **36.29%** *Statcounter (2024)* 

### Objective
- To create an alternative design for the startup's 
- Improve score by 90% for both Mobile and Desktop:
  - Accessability
  - Best Practice
  - SEO 
- Similar UX for Mobile & Desktop 

### Planning
I wanted to stay close to the minimalist theme the website had before.
I searched for minimalist focused [inspiration](https://minimal.gallery/tag/startup/) that other startup's websites had used  

- Use of animation while scrolling
- Big eye catching text

### SVG
I noticed that the website had a Logo in .PNG form. I wanted to use recreate the logo as a SVG as they bring advantages such as file size, and better resizing for different resolutions.
After conducting research to logo's used by other brands, they aimed at simplicity and the use of colors as a result these are the current changes made.
- Simplifying the logo to keep the most important features.
- The psychology of blue reinforces the ideas of saftey and efficiency.
- Animation to bring life

### Information (Scroll)
Initially how the information that was presented was static and in big blocks of text.
The goal of this section was to allow the user to digest the information in small chunks, so the mission the startup was aiming for was clear.
